# Project: Password Generator

Developed by Christian Osborn, 4/18/2020

The goal of the password generator is to get requirements from the user in order to generate a random password. The user has the ability to determine if the password will contain lowercase, uppercase, special, or numeric characters as well as the total length of the password. After the application obtains the user inputs it generates the random password which meets the inputed requirements and sends an alert message to the user showing them their generated password.


The following image demonstrates the application functionality:
